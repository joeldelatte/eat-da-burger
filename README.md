# eat-da-burger
* Keep track of all the burgers you've destroyed in your lifetime. Its burger time, ya'll!

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

# Development

* Create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

* Deploy with Heroku
